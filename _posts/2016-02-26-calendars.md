# Calendars

Every Christmas, my mom gives me a calendar, and every year I chuckle about it, and stuff it behind my piano as soon as I get home. She knows I do this, but buys them anyway. Collectively, there are 12 years behind that piano. 12 years since I stopped worrying about tomorrow.

I wasn't promised tomorrow, so I don't make that promise either. Promises get broken, and there's nothing worse than someone breaking a promise, especially when they know that promise will be broken when they make it. It hurts. It will always hurt.

Not having a calendar is incredibly freeing, no matter the reasoning behind it. I live for today, making the most of it. I write, I drink coffee, and I smoke on the front porch. I love my husband, who returns that love with absolute fervor. I laugh with my beautiful children, I hang out with my friends, I deal with haunting memories as they come, and I visit the grave of an old friend who didn't (or perhaps couldn't) keep his promise. I sit outside at night and stare at the stars, basking in the silence. I don't worry about this party, or that appointment; my family and friends rarely complain if I miss something -- because they get it. They get _me_.

Life isn't about what must be done on a daily basis. It's about what is done with time gifted -- who you impact, who you can make smile, and how many cups of coffee you can consume in a single sitting while discussing Shakespeare, Schr√∂dinger's cat, and the hotness of Johnny Depp.

It's about Prokofiev and My Chemical Romance. It's about the intense hug before he leaves for work, and the Romeo & Juliet kiss before bedtime on the stairs because you lack a balcony. It's about touch, and the intense looks you give and receive, and how long you can continue that look without having to look away. It's about the pressed, daisy necklace he gave with the reasoning that daisies are happy flowers, and if I wear that, then a part of me will always be happy. It's about understanding, and holding on just a little longer, being able to say "I love you", and know that he knows without a shadow of a doubt that it's true.

Calendars aren't about tomorrow. They're about planning every detail of your life out so that the things that make _life _rarely ever happen.

Life isn't about tomorrow. It's about today.
