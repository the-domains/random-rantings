# DORIS AND DAPHNE DISCUSS ZOMBIES

written by Jordan Drew & Luke James

\*I wrote this piece with a friend. I've been asked about it a few times since then, and I thought I'd repost it here since the site it was originally published on is regrettably no more, so with a nod, a curtsy, and big squishy hugs in the direction of my dear friend who made sense out of my ramblings, I give you Doris and Daphne Discuss... Zombies.

**SCENE 1**

_DORIS and Daphne are both in their late thirties. They meet every week at DORIS's house where they sit and chat about the movies they've seen. DORIS always drinks Tequila shots steadily through their chats. Daphne never says anything -- just nods and munches noisily whilst devouring a big, jumbo bag of potato chips._

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

_DORIS & DAPHNE are sat opposite each other at the dining room table. A half-empty bottle of Tequila is in the centre of the table. A big bag of salt. An enormous fruit bowl containing at least twenty lemons. And various half-sucked lemon segments scattered around the table._

DORIS

They were showing some zombie movies back-to-back on Syfy a while ago. Forget when.

(she stares vacantly into space)

Now, I enjoy horror movies, yeah, but not so much the zombie ones because even I can run faster than a zombie. And if I can outrun something, it's not all that freakin' scary to me.

And totally shouldn't be that scary to you either.

(Daphne nods as though on tranquilizers -- continually eating chips)

Something I noticed, though, was that zombies have rockin' AWESOME teeth. Dude, they can bite through a skull cap to get to the desired brainy bits underneath in like a nanosecond! I'd kill for teeth like that.

(she pauses reflectively)

Then again, if I _was _a zombie and had teeth like that, I'd already be killing, and now we're in one of those never ending cyclical conversations people usually get into when they're drunk. And no, I'm not drunk.

(knocks back another shot of tequila complete with salt & lemon)

It never fails though. It's in most of the zombie movies. Zombies eat brains. And generally get to them in one good chomp of their teeth. It bugs me. Or maybe I'm just jealous.

I have a hard time biting an apple.

(knocks back another shot of tequila complete with salt & lemon)

And then.

PAUSE

And then there's another thing that freakin' freaks me out man.

(she hiccups)

Why, in every single movie, do all of the zombies freakin' bleed? I'm not talking about any kind of bleeding here. No.

I'm talking gushy.

(taps each one out with a hard poke of her finger)

Flowy.

Red.

Bloody.

(knocks back another shot of tequila complete with salt & lemon)

Kind of bleedy.

That really blows my mind man. I mean it just doesn't make sense. Doesn't blood coagulate? I'm sure I freakin' read that on Wiki.

(pause)

OK. I mean. I'll give allowances for the freshly dead guys yeah? But the ones that crawled out of the grave all drippy? Give me a break!

(pause)

Then again, maybe it's embalming fluid? I dunno.

(knocks back another shot of tequila complete with salt & lemon)

The whole zombie thing just doesn't make any freakin' sense. There are so many things people could come up with that could be, like, killer scary. But zombies?

Nah.

Not so much.

(DORIS knocks back another shot of tequila complete with salt & lemon then slumps out cold, face down, on the table -- we hear loud munching off-camera and then a TV switched on with screams from a horror movie indispersed with loud crunching from Daphne)

FADE TO BLACK.
