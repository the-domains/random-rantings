I really shouldn't watch television in the morning. I do, but I generally regret it because the breakfast food commercials just creep me out. Why in the world would I be remotely interested in buying toaster pastries after seeing them all over my TV with tiny eyeballs and a mouth, screaming and running for their lives?

It's not just the toaster pastries either. There is a serious creep factor in breakfast cereals too. From a sweetened corn puff wrapped in a towel, fresh from a shower, having zombie milkmen at her door, to little breakfast wheat squares being encouraged by dad (dad, actually being _another _wheat square of course) to keep kids healthy and energized -- creepiness is alive and well.

I just want to yell at that little wheat square that his "dad is psycho!" Don't get so excited, little dude. That kid is gonna eat you! And shame on you cereal-dad -- encouraging your little wheat-kid to do it. He's just a little guy. Why don't you go to school with the human kiddos?

I preferred the ads that used a little old grandmother baking cinnamon squares. Now the little, freaking cinnamon squares are EATING EACH OTHER. The message "_we're so good that even we eat us_" isn't making me want to consume. It makes me want to take the box I have and put it in jail, if I had a jail, which I don't, but there I go again with the whole digression thing.

It's not just food commercials either. I just saw a mobile phone service ad with a pig eating ham saying he "_enjoys the flavor of a __fallen friend_". Dudes! Not only am I not buying your phone service, but I'm not eating ham for a while either.

Thanks, really.
