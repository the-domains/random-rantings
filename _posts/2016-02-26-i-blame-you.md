# I Blame You

I blame you for every smile on my face over the past 10 years; for every skip of my heart.

For the stars that hang in the sky, and the moon that keeps them company, I blame you for giving them back to me... for reminding me of their beauty, and for making me see once again.

For opening my eyes and tearing down my wall; for bringing me out of darkness, or joining me when I couldn't find my way.

For loving me, for making me love you; for every ounce of happiness, I blame you...

And I thank you.

My love, my life, my light, my friend, my sanity, my reason for being -- my husband -- I love you, forever.

Happy Anniversary.
