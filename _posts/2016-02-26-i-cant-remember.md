# I Can't Remember

_I don't know when it happened, but somewhere along the way... I just stopped._

She stopped typing, reading and rereading the line, one of many poems she'd never completely finished, and she thought about how true the words were. She had. Just stopped. And she couldn't remember why or when, only that she had... and it hurt.

She remembered a time in her life when she loved her life. Not life, in general, but_her_life. There were parts that were dark, where she felt alone, and afraid, but she'd even loved those parts. She lived, and she loved, and in that love there was undeniable passion, especially when_they_were together... but then it was gone, and nothing made sense to her anymore.

So she stopped...

Caring...

Being...

Loving...

Living...

Existing...

As she sat and thought about the words on the screen, she wondered if once again this would be another piece left unfinished, and then she thought yes... it would. Finishing was not something she ever did. Finality scared her more than the dark. When something ended it was over... gone... forever. There were a few pieces she_almost_finished, enough that the words on the pages were understandable when read by others, but they always lacked the final scene, or sentence, or word... because that would have been too close to final.

Mira opened a file so she could look at the last poem she'd almost finished, and as she read through it, she wondered if maybe this time..._this time_she could end it... if maybe this time she could say goodbye...

**_I Can't Remember_**

_The radio's on,_

_It's never turned off._

_I can't remember the last time I_

_Was around quiet_

_The lights are still off,_

_I haven't turned them on._

_I can't remember the last time I_

_Was around light_

_It's smoky in here,_

_A bad habit of mine_

_I can't remember the last time I_

_Was around fresh air_

_I'm so tired,_

_Tired of life_

_I can't remember the last time I_

_Really slept_

_You still haunt me_

_Memories and dreams of you_

_I can't remember the last time I ..._

And then she remembered what it was she couldn't before... She flipped off the computer and sat in her darkness, trying desperately to remember his face. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5d10c447-7b73-410a-98a5-b7bc6acb653d.jpg)
