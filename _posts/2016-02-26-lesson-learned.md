# Lesson Learned

So, yeah, I've kinda been MIA for awhile on both facebook and twitter... and this blog thing that I've never really rocked at anyway... There was this whole me being pregnant thing that happened and it wasn't an easy pregnancy. High blood pressure, bed rest, gestational diabetes -- carpal tunnel so bad the fingers on my hands were completely numb and would go to sleep if I tried to type and hurt like hell if I tried to hold a pen in my hand. Good news, I had the baby in August and even though the tips of my fingers are still a little numb, I'm doing much better, and baby girl is perfect... though I think she's got my number.

Sophie isn't much with the sleeping thing, which I thought would be fine because I've had insomnia since like forever, so I thought I could handle a teeny tiny little baby with an up all night kind of schedule.

I totally can't.

I'm freaking tired, man.

So my mother in law, who is absolutely the best mother in law EVER, came yesterday so I could get in a nap, and nap I did. I got a full night's sleep yesterday afternoon. It was AWESOME. So when Sophie started doing her "I'm not sleeping again tonight" thing this morning around 3:00, I laughed. I actually told her to go ahead. Never sleep again. I'm good, chicka, I had sleep and am wide awake.

Fifteen minutes later, baby girl fell asleep.

At 3:30, the internet went out.

At 3:35, I realized the cable box wasn't working and I couldn't change the channel on the TV which was stuck on some infomercial that was selling two of something for the price of one. Something I wasn't even remotely tempted to buy.

At 3:36 I realized Netflix doesn't work without an internet connection.

Neither does the iPod, and for some reason, my smart phone was acting stupid, and refused to allow me to get anywhere on the internet.

It took until 3:40 for me to realize I've read EVERY. DAMN. BOOK. IN. THE. HOUSE.

I looked at my innocent, teeny-tiny brand new baby girl, and she smiled in her sleep... or maybe it was gas, but it seriously looked like a smile. She slept until 7:45 this morning. Plenty of time for me to have gotten a decent night's sleep.

I learned a valuable lesson last night.

Never try and one-up a newborn. They will beat you, even in their sleep.
