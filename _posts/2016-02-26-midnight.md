He knew he saw _something_, but he wasn't sure if what he'd seen was _real_.

Alice had always been a bit out there. He'd warned her a thousand times she was too adventurous for her own good, but this was nothing like any of those times, and now he was left to tell her tale... if anyone would listen. "It's not so much a goodbye, as a see you later," she'd told him over coffee just two days before._Only two days?_It seemed much longer. Alice cared for him, but not as much as she cared for her ghosts, and perhaps that was why he'd been left behind. Because he hadn't believed. Maybe they weren't ghosts. Maybe they were aliens; maybe she'd drugged him with some sort of hallucinogen or... or maybe something else was going on... something that might've made more sense had he time to_really_think about it. He wasn't even sure he'd be able to recount Alice's story -- not in a believable manner anyway. He knew he saw_something_, but he wasn't sure if what he'd seen was_real_. One thing he knew. She was gone, and after what happened when the clock struck midnight --
