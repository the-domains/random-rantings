Ever since I was a kid, I'd always wanted an umbrella. It's one of those things I knew I wanted, but never actually thought about buying until I was nowhere near a store, so yes, I'm 35, and no, to my recollection, I've never really had one before.

My wonderful mother-in-law actually bought me one for Christmas last year. I LOVED IT! It was so incredibly cute, small, pink and came in its own handy, dandy carrying-case and everything. It was perfect.

It has only ever been used once.

See, it rained not long after I got it. My excitement could not be contained. I grabbed it then yanked it out of its little case, and ran outside. Opening it up, I stepped out into the rain, ecstatic. It totally worked (I'm enamored by the smallest of ideologies.) I remember being so happy, twirling around with my new umbrella. Yes, I twirled. Shut up.

It was as I was twirling in the rain, that I first heard the thunder. Followed very quickly by a bolt of lightning that wouldn't have looked out of place in an old B movie. It was at about this time I noticed the incredible amount of metal keeping the umbrella in its neat-o umbrella form.

Wait.

_What?_

The skeletal form of an umbrella is metal right? My brain quickly calculated several, different possible new scenarios that didn't include me simply dancing in the rain.

Doesn't metal make an umbrella more of a decorative lightning rod of sorts?

Even though I wasn't getting wet in the rain, wasn't I in more danger of being struck by lightning? Who invented this death-trap? What insane person came up with the idea? Why are we all actually using these contraptions?

Well. I guess it's all a question of semantics.

See, for Christmas last year, my mother-in-law bought me the most wonderfully, perfect, pink parasol.
