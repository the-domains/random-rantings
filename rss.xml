            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Calendars</h1><p>Every Christmas, my mom gives me a calendar, and every year I chuckle about it, and stuff it behind my piano as soon as I get home. She knows I do this, but buys them anyway. Collectively, there are 12 years behind that piano. 12 years since I stopped worrying about tomorrow.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f7b9b3cdc2239537ca3a20fc5f8f245605a32d89.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Lesson Learned]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Lesson Learned</h1><p>So, yeah, I’ve kinda been MIA for awhile on both facebook and twitter… and this blog thing that I’ve never really rocked at anyway… There was this whole me being pregnant thing that happened, and it wasn’t an easy pregnancy. High blood pressure, bed rest, gestational diabetes – carpal tunnel so bad the fingers on my hands were completely numb and would go to sleep if I tried to type and hurt like hell if I tried to hold a pen in my hand. Good news, I had the baby in August (2012) and even though the tips of my fingers are still a little numb, I’m doing much better, and baby girl is perfect… though I think she’s got my number.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/cb8705e63d67f840e44a5d98a8a7877658c87fda.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>You were Right</h1><p>It was déjà vu. She’d lived this moment only a few hours before, and no matter what she said, he was leaving and she couldn’t make him change his mind. She looked at him, her eyes brimming with unshed tears, blinking them back as best she could. It wasn’t supposed to turn into this, but here they stood in their driveway – she was crying like a ninny and he was pleading with her to stop making a scene.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b1f2239c0f56a643c732094f5e5ce01578639fc6.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>One Last Time</h1><p>It wasn’t supposed to end this way. All or nothing, not one or the other. It wasn’t fair to know he had to go on without her. His sister came over often, saying it was time to move on, to let go, and she was right, but it didn’t make the decision to leave any easier.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6d20dd810225de238e79386e33ae3e238727a130.jpg"></article>]]></description>
